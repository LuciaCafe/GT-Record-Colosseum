English is not my native language, sorry in advance for any translation errors.

Thank you very much for downloading this application.

The goal of Collosseum Records is to help keep track of the users you fight in the coliseum, from the game Guardian Tales.

To use it you just have to write the name of a user in the white bar and press the "Search User" button.

Then, the number of victories and defeats you have had against that user until now will be displayed.

Below the victory and defeat values there will be a button that is used to add 1 to their respective value.

Depending on how the battle turns out, add victories and defeats, so you will be able to know in the future, 
when you meet that user again, whether or not you can win against him.
